        <h1>About the Food Search Web App</h1>

        <h2>What is the problem we're hoping to solve?</h2>
        <p>The Food Search Web App aims to address the challenge of quickly and easily obtaining nutritional information for various food items. Users often need a convenient way to access the nutritional content of different foods, whether for personal health tracking or dietary planning.</p>

        <h2>Who are the people who care about this problem?</h2>
        <p>The stakeholders for this web app include individuals who are health-conscious, fitness enthusiasts, nutritionists, and anyone interested in making informed food choices. The general public, as well as professionals in the health and wellness industry, can benefit from the quick access to detailed nutritional information.</p>

        <h2>How would our proposed system solve the information problem?</h2>
        <p>The Food Search Web App utilizes the FoodData Central API to retrieve detailed nutritional information based on user input. By providing a simple and user-friendly interface, the system allows users to search for food items and receive comprehensive nutritional data, enabling them to make informed decisions about their diet and nutrition.</p>

        <h2>API Information</h2>
        <p>We have chosen to work with the FoodData Central API as it offers a comprehensive database of food-related information, including nutrient data. This API is maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and provides reliable and up-to-date information on a wide range of food items, helping us address the information problem of obtaining accurate and detailed nutritional data.</p>

        <h2>A description of the front-end technology used</h2>
        <p>The front-end of the web app is developed using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This approach ensures simplicity and accessibility, allowing users to access the application from various devices without the need for complex frameworks. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for users to search for and view nutritional information.</p>

        <h2>A description of the back-end technology used</h2>
        <p>We've built the backend using Node.js, harnessing the power of JavaScript with Express for efficient API development. Nodemon ensures automatic server restarts during the development process, enhancing productivity. To manage data, We hacv integrated Supabase, a cloud-based database service. This stack enables the creation of dynamic and responsive web applications with a solid foundation in Node.js, Express for server capabilities, Nodemon for streamlined development, and Supabase for reliable database management.</p>






        <h2>What devices are you targeting as part of your project?</h2>
        <p>The Food Search Web App is designed to be responsive and accessible on a variety of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The responsive design ensures a consistent and user-friendly experience across different screen sizes and resolutions.</p>
